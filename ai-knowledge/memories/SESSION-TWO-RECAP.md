# Session Two Recap: Making Projects AI IDE Ready

## Overview
Session Two focused on transforming any project into an "AI-native" or "Cursor-ready" codebase. The main goal was to set up explicit project structure, documentation, and configuration files that help AI assistants understand and work effectively with your codebase.

**Core Principle**: Make your project "AI IDE Ready" by providing clear context, conventions, and guidelines that AI tools can reference.

---

## Topics Discussed

### 1. **Understanding AGENTS.md - The AI README**
The `AGENTS.md` file serves as the central source of truth for AI assistants working on your project. Think of it as a comprehensive README specifically designed for AI IDEs.

**What AGENTS.md Contains**:
- Setup commands (build, run, test, deploy)
- Project structure and architecture
- Technology stack details
- Code style and naming conventions
- Common development tasks and patterns
- Troubleshooting guides
- Testing strategies

**Why It Matters**:
- AI assistants reference this file to understand project conventions
- Ensures consistency across all AI-generated code
- Reduces hallucinations by providing explicit patterns
- Acts as onboarding documentation for both AI and developers

**Example Structure**:
```markdown
# Project Name - Project Guide

## Setup Commands
[Build, run, test commands]

## Project Structure
[Directory layout and organization]

## Architecture & Patterns
[Technology stack, design patterns]

## Code Style & Conventions
[Naming, formatting, best practices]

## Common Development Tasks
[Step-by-step guides for common tasks]
```

### 2. **Essential Cursor Configuration Files**

#### `.cursorignore`
**Purpose**: Exclude noise from AI context to optimize performance and relevance

**What to Ignore**:
```
target/
build/
node_modules/
.m2/
.gradle/
*.log
.idea/
.vscode/
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster AI responses
- More relevant context
- Reduced token usage
- Cleaner suggestions

#### `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
**Purpose**: Always-applied context rules for AI behavior

**Common Rules**:
- `commit-rules.mdc` - Commit message conventions (e.g., conventional commits)
- `project-context.mdc` - Points to AGENTS.md for project conventions
- `test-rules.mdc` - Testing standards and patterns

**Example** (`commit-rules.mdc`):
```markdown
Use git conventional commits
```

#### `.cursor/mcp.json`
**Purpose**: Configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for extended capabilities

**What is MCP?**: Protocol that extends Cursor's capabilities with integrations

**Common MCP Servers**:
- **GitHub MCP**: Repository operations, PR creation, issue management
- **Filesystem MCP**: Advanced file operations
- **Database MCP**: Direct database queries and exploration

**Example Configuration**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: Never commit `mcp.json` with real tokens. Add to `.gitignore`.

---

### 3. **Cmd+K: Inline AI Agent Editing**

**What is Cmd+K?**
- Quick inline editing powered by AI
- Context-aware code modifications
- Faster than switching to chat for focused edits

**When to Use Cmd+K**:
- ‚úÖ Refactoring single methods
- ‚úÖ Adding error handling
- ‚úÖ Writing boilerplate code
- ‚úÖ Quick documentation additions
- ‚úÖ Variable renaming with context

**When to Use Chat Instead**:
- ‚ùå Multi-file changes
- ‚ùå Architectural questions
- ‚ùå Planning complex refactors
- ‚ùå Learning about codebase

**Common Patterns**:
```
Cmd+K: "Add javadoc to this method"
Cmd+K: "Add null checks and validation"
Cmd+K: "Refactor to use Java streams"
Cmd+K: "Add error handling with custom exceptions"
Cmd+K: "Convert to builder pattern"
```

**Best Practices**:
1. Select the relevant code block first
2. Be specific in your prompt
3. Reference project conventions when needed
4. Review generated code before accepting
5. Iterate if the first result isn't perfect

---

### 4. **Feature Development with AI Prompts**

**Topic**: Created comprehensive prompt templates for implementing new features consistently

**Feature Development Template** (`feature-development.md`):
- Structured prompts for CRUD operations
- Delete operations example
- Appointment scheduling example
- Advanced search enhancements
- Testing and validation patterns

**7-Step Implementation Checklist**:
1. Domain Model & Database
2. Repository Layer
3. Controller Layer  
4. View Layer (Thymeleaf)
5. Testing (Unit & Integration)
6. Code Quality & Documentation
7. Integration & Verification

**Usage**:
```
I need to implement a new feature: [FEATURE_NAME]

**Feature Description:**
As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]

**Technical Requirements:**
- [Database changes]
- [UI requirements]
- [Security requirements]

Please implement this feature following @AGENTS.md
```

---

### 5. **MCP Tools Available**

**GitHub MCP Tools Explored**:
- Repository management (create, fork, branch)
- File operations (read, create, update, push)
- Pull request creation and management
- Issue tracking and management
- Commit operations
- Search repositories and code

**Use Cases**:
- Automated PR creation with proper descriptions
- Reading code from other repositories
- Managing GitHub workflows from Cursor
- Searching across organizations

**Limitation Discovered**: 
- Read-only tokens require manual PR creation via URL
- Write access requires proper GitHub token permissions

---

### 6. **Git Workflow for AI-Ready Projects**

**Best Practices**:
- One commit per logical change
- Use conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)
- Sign commits (`-s` flag) for contributor agreement
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issues/PRs when applicable

**Example Commits from Session**:
```bash
git commit -m "docs(ai-knowledge): add feature development prompt template"
git commit -m "chore: update gitignore and add cursor configuration"
git commit -m "feat: add AGENTS.md for AI IDE documentation"
```
