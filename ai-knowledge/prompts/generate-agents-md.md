# Prompt: Generate AGENTS.md for Your Project

## Purpose
This prompt helps you create a comprehensive `AGENTS.md` file that serves as the single source of truth for AI assistants working on your codebase.

---

## The Prompt

```
I need you to create a comprehensive AGENTS.md file for my project that will serve as the primary knowledge base for AI coding assistants like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other LLM-based tools.

Please analyze my codebase and create an AGENTS.md that includes:

## 1. Setup Commands
- Prerequisites (languages, frameworks, tools, versions)
- Installation steps
- Build commands
- Run/start development server commands
- Test commands
- Common utility commands (lint, format, deploy, etc.)

## 2. Project Structure
- Directory tree showing main folders and their purposes
- Where to find key components (models, controllers, views, services, etc.)
- Configuration file locations
- Test structure

## 3. Architecture & Patterns
- Technology stack (frameworks, libraries, databases)
- Design patterns used (MVC, Repository, Service layer, etc.)
- Key architectural decisions
- Data flow and relationships
- Authentication/authorization approach (if applicable)

## 4. Code Style & Conventions

Please make it:
‚úÖ Concise but comprehensive
‚úÖ Code-focused with actual commands and examples
‚úÖ Practical (include copy-pastable commands)
‚úÖ Structured for easy scanning by both humans and AI
‚úÖ Focused on what developers need to know to be productive immediately

Analyze these files to understand the project:
@[list key files: package.json, pom.xml, requirements.txt, README.md, etc.]
@[key source directories]
```

---

## How to Use This Prompt

### Step 1: Prepare Context
Open your project in Cursor and select relevant files to give context:
- Package manager files: `@package.json`, `@pom.xml`, `@requirements.txt`, `@Gemfile`, etc.
- Configuration: `@README.md`, `.env.example`, config files
- Key source files: Controllers, models, main entry points

### Step 2: Customize the Prompt
Adjust sections based on your project type:
- **Web API**: Emphasize endpoints, middleware, database
- **Frontend**: Focus on components, state management, styling
- **CLI Tool**: Highlight commands, flags, configuration
- **Library**: Document public API, usage examples

### Step 3: Run in Cursor Chat
1. Open Cursor Chat (Cmd+L)
2. Attach relevant files with @ mentions
3. Paste the customized prompt
4. Review and refine the output

### Step 4: Iterate
Ask follow-up questions to improve:
- "Add more details about the authentication flow"
- "Include examples for common REST patterns we use"
- "Add troubleshooting for Docker issues"

### Step 5: Save and Maintain
- Save as `ai-knowledge/AGENTS.md`
- Update when architecture changes
- Add new sections as patterns emerge
- Keep commands up-to-date

---

## Example Variations by Project Type

### For a React/Next.js Project
```
Focus on:
- Component structure and naming
- State management approach (Redux, Context, Zustand)
- Styling conventions (CSS modules, Tailwind, styled-components)
- API integration patterns
- Routing conventions
```

### For a Python Django/Flask Project
```
Focus on:
- Virtual environment setup
- Database migrations (Django ORM, Alembic)
- View/serializer patterns
- Testing with pytest
- Environment variables and configuration
```

### For a Java Spring Boot Project
```
Focus on:
- Maven/Gradle commands
- Application profiles (dev, test, prod)
- JPA entity relationships
- Controller/Service/Repository layers
- Testing with JUnit and MockMvc
```

### For a Mobile App (React Native, Flutter)
```
Focus on:
- Simulator/emulator commands
- Platform-specific code
- Navigation structure
- State management
- Build and release process
```

### For a Microservices Architecture
```
Focus on:
- Service communication patterns
- API gateway configuration
- Service discovery
- Deployment strategy
- Inter-service dependencies
```

## What Makes a Great AGENTS.md?

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use actual commands that can be copy-pasted
- Include file paths and directory structure
- Document patterns consistently used
- Add code snippets showing conventions
- Link to relevant external docs
- Update when architecture changes
- Keep it focused and scannable

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Write generic descriptions without specifics
- Include outdated commands or paths
- Document every single file
- Write long paragraphs (use lists!)
- Forget to update when codebase evolves
- Include sensitive information (keys, passwords)

---

## Testing Your AGENTS.md

After creating AGENTS.md, test it with these prompts in Cursor:

1. **Setup Test**:
   ```
   @AGENTS.md How do I set up this project for local development?
   ```

2. **Feature Addition Test**:
   ```
   @AGENTS.md Following project conventions, add a new [entity/endpoint/component]
   ```

3. **Architecture Test**:
   ```
   @AGENTS.md Explain the architecture of this application
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting Test**:
   ```
   @AGENTS.md I'm getting error X, how do I fix it?
   ```

If the AI gives accurate, helpful responses using your AGENTS.md, it's working!

---

## Maintenance Schedule

### When to Update AGENTS.md:

üìÖ **Immediately**:
- Major architecture changes
- New frameworks or libraries added
- Development workflow changes
- New deployment process

üìÖ **Regularly** (monthly):
- Verify commands still work
- Update version numbers
- Add new troubleshooting tips learned

üìÖ **As Needed**:
- New team member onboarding feedback
- Common questions in PRs/Slack
- Repeated issues found

---

## Integration with .cursor/rules

Create a rule file that points to AGENTS.md:

**File**: `.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc`
```markdown
---
alwaysApply: true
---
To understand this project's architecture, conventions, and development workflow, 
always reference @AGENTS.md in ai-knowledge/AGENTS.md
```

This ensures AI assistants always have access to your project knowledge.

---

## Advanced: Multiple AGENTS Files

For large projects, consider splitting by domain:

```
ai-knowledge/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AGENTS.md                  # Main overview
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AGENTS-BACKEND.md          # Backend specific
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AGENTS-FRONTEND.md         # Frontend specific
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AGENTS-INFRASTRUCTURE.md   # DevOps, deployment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AGENTS-TESTING.md          # Testing strategies
```

Then reference them in specific .cursor rules for different directories.

---
